create the project: 

  copy the directory from nrfm_spi
  ~/nRF5_SDK_17.0.2_d674dde/examples/peripheral/nrfx_spim

  rename 10056 to 10059 in directory names, and file names. 
  change 10056 to 10059 in project files.


testing the spi xfer: 

  use the default spim instance 3. xfer works even with nfc pins. 
  move away from nfc pins. captured proper spi signals on an oscilloscope. 

  change to spim instance 0. xfer got stuck on nfc pins. non-nfc pins ok.
